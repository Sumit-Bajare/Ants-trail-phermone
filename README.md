# Ants-trail-phermone

Abstract 
In the 1950s, the famous cyberneticists Gordon Pask performed an experiment called the
Pask’s ear. Unfortunately, the details of their experiment and methods are unavailable.
Therefore, their experiment has not been replicated, and the precise experiment conditions
underlying their results remain unknown. But their initial step has given rewarding results.
This paper presents a self-organisation system similar to Gordon Pask’s model where the
pheromone trails laid by the ants are an allegory for the metallic strings in Pask's ear and
flow of electric current in the system is replace by rate at which the ants enter.
